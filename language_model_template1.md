- **Shared by [Optional]:** {{ shared_by | join(', ') | default("More information needed", true)}}
- **Model type:** {{ model_type | default("Language model", true)}}
- **Language(s) (NLP):** {{ language | join(', ') | default("More information needed", true)}}
- **License:** {{ model_license | default("More information needed", true)}}
- **Parent Model:** {{ "  [Parent Model]({0})".format(repo_link) if parent_model_link else "More information needed"}}

# Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

## Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->
<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say "more info needed." -->
{% if direct_use is defined %}
{{ direct_use }}
{% elif model_task in task_list %}
{{ lm_task_entries[model_task]['direct_use'] }}
{% else %}
More information needed.
{% endif %}

## Downstream Use [Optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->
<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say "more info needed." -->
{% if downstream_use is defined %} 
{{ downstream_use }}
{% elif model_task in task_list %} 
{{ lm_task_entries[model_task]['downstream_use'] }}
{% else %} 
More information needed.
{% endif %}

## Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->
<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say "more info needed." -->
{% if out_of_scope_use is defined %}
{{ out_of_scope_use }}
{% elif model_task in task_list %}
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. {{ lm_task_entries[model_task]['misuse'] }}
{% else %}
More information needed.
{% endif %}

# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->
{% if bias_risks_limiations is defined %}
{{ bias_risks_limitations }}
{% else %}
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.
{% endif %}

## Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

{% if bias_recommendations is defined %}
{{ bias_recommendations }}
{% else %}
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recomendations.
{% endif %}
